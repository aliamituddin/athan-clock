<p>The LE privacy feature allows devices to periodically generate new address to
use over the air. This behavior greatly reduces the ability for a scanner to
track broadcasting Bluetooth low energy devices over a period of time.</p>
<p>There are two privacy variants defined by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>: Controller-based and
Host-based. In Host-based privacy, the Host is responsible for managing all
aspects of the privacy feature - generating new addresses to use and resolving
private addresses sent by peers to determine their identity. In Controller-based
privacy, the privacy feature is largely implemented in the Link Layer of the
Controller. However, interaction with the Host is required for configuration and
to manage communication with other devices using privacy.</p>
<p>The BLE5-Stack supports only the Controller-based privacy variant as defined by the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a> (Vol 1, Part A, Section 5.4.5). The Link Layer privacy feature is
always enabled in the BLE5-Stack.</p>
<p>Privacy is discussed in the following sections of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>. It is
suggested to review and familiarize yourself with these sections before
continuing.</p>

<h2>Privacy and Address Types<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-and-address-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before going too in depth into a discussion of the BLE5-Stack privacy
implementation, one should have a thorough understanding about Device Address
Types as defined by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a> and how they are used by the BLE5-Stack. The
section below is intended to refresh the key concepts in order to provide
context for the topic of Privacy. For other important implementation details,
see the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a> or the BLE5-Stack API Guide.</p>

<h3>Device Addresses in the BLE Core Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#device-addresses-in-the-ble-core-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>According to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>, all Bluetooth device addresses can be divided into
two types: Public (0x00) and Random (0x01). The Random address type can be
categorized into two subtypes: Static or Private. The Private address subtype
can be further divided into two subtypes: Resolvable or Non-Resolvable. These
divisions can be visualized with the following tree:</p>

<h3>Using Device Addresses in BLE5-Stack Applications<a class="headerlink" href="#using-device-addresses-in-stack-applications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Configuring Local Device Address Mode</strong></p>
<p>A BLE5-Stack application configures its own device address mode with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addrMode</span></code> parameter of <a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/group___g_a_p.html#gabd7c5f3cc85470854cf425e7e49b5ca5">GAP_DeviceInit()</a>. This API must be called
when initializing the GAP layer and before attempting to start
discovery or advertising. See <a class="reference internal" href="#gapbondmgr-enable-rpa"><span class="std std-numref">Listing 77.</span></a>. It can only be
called once per device reset.</p>
<p>The modes that are supported by the BLE5-Stack are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="26%" />

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID</td>
<td>0x02</td>
<td>the local device will always use an RPA that can be resolved to
a Public Identity Address. The device will only accept requests
from peers who use its RPA over the air. It will not accept requests
if the request is being directed to its identity address.</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>A BLE5-Stack device can only change its address modes using GAP_DeviceInit. If
the address mode is changed, or if a different Random Static address is used,
the BLE5-Stack all existing bonds and local identification information will be
erased. The BLE5-Stack does not allow the user to configure the local device to use
a Non-resolvable Private Address. By default, in the BLE5-Stack, a Random Static
address does not change after a power cycle and its identification information
is stored in NV.</p>
<p>The device can use the GAP_GetDevAddress() command to easily receive local
address information for the device.</p>
<p><strong>Interpreting Addresses in</strong> BLE5-Stack <strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p>Addresses can be received in GAP &amp; GAP Bond Manager events. Address
information can also be queried using LinkDB. When receiving Peer Address
information, the values will be different depending on whether or not the peer
device identity information is in the Resolving List or not. The address types
that may be seen for peer devices is as follows:</p>

<p>If a device adds the peer identity information to the resolving list, it will
only receive the identity address in the application, not the RPA the peer is
currently using.</p>
<p>If an RPA is received for a bonded device in an event, this means that the
address is not present in the resolving list. The address can still be resolved
to its identity address at the application’s discretion, but it will always
receive ADDRTYPE_RANDOM when receiving messages from the Controller.</p>
<p><strong>Communicating Address Information to Controller</strong></p>

<div class="section" id="resolving-private-addresses">
<h2>Resolving Private Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-private-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The addresses we generally use in privacy discussions are RPAs and Identity
Addresses. As mentioned above, a device using an RPA periodically changes the
address it uses over the air. This happens at a specified timeout interval. The
addresses it uses are generated with an Identity Resolving Key (<a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-irk"><span class="xref std std-term">IRK</span></a>).
This key associates the Resolvable Private Address to an Identity Address that
remains constant.</p>
<p>The privacy feature inhibits tracking from untrusted peer devices. However, some
devices may need the ability to recognize, and be recognized by, their peer
devices after their RPA has changed. Since RPAs are associated with an identity
address, they can be resolved to that fixed address, if a peer device has the
right key.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the Controller-based privacy variant, the Controller and
the Host each manage different aspects of privacy. Prior to Bluetooth Core
Specification v4.2, the Host was responsible for all aspects of privacy. The
Link Layer Privacy feature was introduced in Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2.
This feature hands off the repetitive work (generating &amp; resolving addresses) to
the Controller, while the Host is responsible for configuration and
managing identity information.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between the Host and the Controller is depicted
in the flowchart below and is covered in detail in the following sections:</p>
<img alt="../_images/ditaa-79b92513a9dae06ed486bf4372de9761504deea3.png" src="../_images/ditaa-79b92513a9dae06ed486bf4372de9761504deea3.png" />

<h4>Setting Privacy-related GAP Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-privacy-related-gap-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Configure Local RPA Usage</strong></p>
<p>The Host is responsible for setting the address mode used by the Controller as
discussed above using the GAP_DeviceInit command. This contains the addrMode
the Host wants the Controller to use when setting up its device address. The
addrMode cannot be changed unless the device is reset. If the addrMode changes
between resets, the BLE5-Stack will erase and regenerate all local identification
information as well as erase bonding information for known peers.</p>
<p>If a BLE5-Stack device is configured to use an RPA, the Host will also share its
local identification information with the Controller upon initialization to use
for local device address generation and to resolve the local device address when
sent by peers.</p>
<p><strong>Resolvable Private Address Timeout</strong></p>

<h4>Exchanging Supported Privacy Feature Information<a class="headerlink" href="#exchanging-supported-privacy-feature-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Any device that is operating as a Central or a Peripheral must contain the GAP
Service. The GAP Service contains 2 privacy-related characteristics: the Central
Address Resolution Characteristic and the Resolvable Private Address Only
characteristic.</p>
<p>In order to use Privacy, the GAP Bond Manager requires the stack’s GATT client
to read the peer device’s GAP characteristics. In order to accomplish this, the
stack must be built with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GATT_NO_CLIENT</span></code> compiler option disabled so that the
GATT client is included. See <a class="reference internal" href="creating-a-custom-bluetooth-low-energy-application.html#sec-compiler-options"><span class="std std-ref">Compiler Options</span></a> for more information on
how to change predefined project symbols.</p>
<p><strong>Central Address Resolution Characteristic (CAR)</strong></p>
<p>Any device operating as a Central that supports the Link Layer Privacy feature
must include a Central Address Resolution (CAR) Characteristic in its GAP
Service. The value of this characteristic signifies whether or not the Central
device can resolve its own address in the Controller. Since the Link Layer
privacy feature is always enabled in the BLE5-Stack, the GAP Service implemented by
the BLE5-Stack projects sets this value automatically.</p>
<p>A Peripheral wishing to send Directed Advertisements when the peer Central is
using an RPA must read this characteristic before proceeding. The BLE5-Stack reads
this characteristic if the local device is a Peripheral that has bonded to a
peer using an RPA. This characteristic is checked by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GapAdv_enable()</span></code> when
attempting to send directed advertisements in the BLE5-Stack.</p>
<p><strong>Resolvable Private Address Only (RPAO)</strong></p>
<p>If this characteristic is present in the GAP Service and its value is ‘0’, the
local device will reject any incoming requests from peers if the identity
address of the local device is used over the air. The BLE5-Stack applications
using Privacy will always contain the RPAO characteristic with a value of ‘0’ in
their GATT Table.</p>
<p>The RPAO is read automatically by the GAP Bond Manager if it has bonded to a
peer using a private address. If a <a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/bcomdef_8h.html#a8252484a1c4ed5e71a7cf87bc896c4d5">GATT_MSG_EVENT</a> with an

sets the peer in <strong>Network Privacy mode</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if a <a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/bcomdef_8h.html#a8252484a1c4ed5e71a7cf87bc896c4d5">GATT_MSG_EVENT</a> response with a <a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/group___a_t_t___m_e_t_h_o_d___d_e_f_i_n_e_s.html#ga1d9775a7ea35bc6cd84af55d201a9ef8">ATT_ERROR_RSP</a>

<div class="section" id="managing-identity-information">
<h4>Managing Identity Information<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-identity-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, RPAs can be associated with a long-term identity address
using an IRK. During Phase 3 of the pairing process, BLE5-Stack devices using RPAs
exchange their IRKs and their Identity Addresses with their peers, as described
in [Vol3] Part H, Section 3.6 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>. From this point on, given that
a peer has shared a valid, non-zero <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-irk"><span class="xref std std-term">IRK</span></a> and uses a
<a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolvable-private-address"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolvable Private Address</span></a>, the peer device can resolve this <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-rpa"><span class="xref std std-term">RPA</span></a>
into the associated <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-identity-address"><span class="xref std std-term">Identity Address</span></a>.</p>
<p>If a Peer using an RPA exchanges an IRK containing all zeros, the IRK will not
be considered valid and its RPA will not be resolved. Only devices using Random
Static, Public, or Non-Resolvable Private device addresses should exchange a
zero-IRK.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="managing-the-resolving-list">
<h4>Managing the Resolving List<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-the-resolving-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Host is responsible for sharing the Identity Information it has
collected with the Controller for resolution purposes. It is also responsible
for removing devices from the resolving list when they are no longer needed or
if the Identity Information has changed.</p>
<p>If the Host wishes to use device filtering and still receive requests from
incoming known peers who are using RPAs, it must provide the identification
information to the Controller. Care should be taken in situations in which the
Resolving List and the White List are both used. If your application requires
White List filtering of devices using RPAs, please reference the
<a class="reference internal" href="#sec-privacy-and-white-list"><span class="std std-ref">Privacy and the White List</span></a> section below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolving-list">
<h3>Resolving List<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the Link Layer Privacy feature was introduced, the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolving-list"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolving List</span></a>
concept was also introduced. A Resolving List contains device identity
information for known devices that can be used by the Link Layer to resolve RPAs
in the Controller before passing events to the Host. The resolving list contents
determine how the Controller and Host communicate about devices using RPAs. A
Resolving List is necessary in order to use device filtering with devices using
RPAs.</p>
<p>A resolving list record entry consists of the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>an Identity Address</li>
<li>the address type of Identity Address (Public or Random Static)</li>
<li>the IRK used to resolve the Identity Address</li>
<li>which Privacy mode the device is in (Network or Device)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After bonding with a peer device, the Host can create a resolving list
record entry for the device using the information shared during Phase 3 of the
pairing process. This entry is added to the Resolving List which the Controller
will use to process incoming RPAs. The <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolvable-private-address"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolvable Private Address</span></a> of a
peer device is not used at the Host layer of the local device after bonding if
its identity information is stored in the Resolving List. Instead, the RPA is
resolved in the Controller and the Host is only given the associated peer’s
<a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-identity-address"><span class="xref std std-term">Identity Address</span></a> when receiving messages from the controller. In the
BLE5-Stack, the GAP Bond Manager automatically adds devices to the Resolving List
after bonding.</p>
<p>If the peer device identity information is not in the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolving-list"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolving List</span></a>,
then the link layer may pass such link events to the host for further resolution
(if <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> filtering is not used). For  more information about
resolving addresses in the Host, see <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-privacy-host-resolving"><span class="std std-ref">Host Address Resolution in BLE5-Stack</span></a>.</p>
<p>In the rare event the peer IRK is no longer valid, one of the GAPBOND_ERASE
parameters can be used to erase the bond record and remove the entry from the
Resolving List. If the device has been added to the Resolving List, it will be
removed automatically by the GAP Bond Manager. A peer IRK will only become
invalid if the peer device has reset its identity information for some reason.
This does not occur during normal operation but it might happen after a power
cycle, device reset to factory conditions, NV data corruption, etc.</p>
<p>Upon reset, the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolving-list"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolving List</span></a> is empty and it’s up to the host to
add and remove devices from the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolving-list"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolving List</span></a>. This is automatically
handled for the application when using the GAP Bond Manager. Devices are added
to the Resolving List when a bond is added and are removed from the Resolving
List when the bond is removed.</p>
<p>If the local device receives incoming Link Layer events from the peer device
that is using a <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolvable-private-address"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolvable Private Address</span></a>, it will attempt to resolve
the address using the known IRKs in its Resolving List to see if it matches an
Identity Address.</p>
<p>If the Resolving List is full, the Host is responsible for determining if any of
the existing Resolving List entries should be replaced if a new bond is formed.
Any request from a peer using an RPA not in the resolving list will be
forwarded to the Host as long as device filtering is disabled.</p>
<div class="section" id="resolving-list-limitations">
<h4>Resolving List Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-list-limitations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The BLE5-Stack has been tested &amp; verified with a Resolving List that holds 10
entries. The size of the Resolving List can be modified by setting the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES</span></code> to the desired number. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES</span></code> must be
smaller than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GAP_BONDINGS_MAX</span></code>.</p>
<p>Resolving Lists with sizes higher than 10 have not been extensively
profiled. Potential limiting factors to Resolving List size include available
Heap and resolution timing considerations: There must be enough memory to store
the desired number of Resolving List entries and each entry in the resolving
list increases the worst case time to resolve a private address. If it takes too
long for the local device to respond, the peer may have stopped listening. The
maximum Resolving List size the BLE5-Stack can support is 56.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you need fewer than 10 entries, you can reduce the size of
the resolving list to increase the performance of the device. The resolving list
must hold at least one entry if the BLE5-Stack device uses an RPA as its device
address.</p>
<p>The Host Test application as configured in the <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-privacy-normal-usecase"><span class="std std-ref">Using Privacy in BLE5-Stack</span></a>
section below has been demonstrated to resolve up to 56 private device addresses
when <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES</span></code> is set to 56.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="privacy-and-the-white-list">
<span id="sec-privacy-and-white-list"></span><h4>Privacy and the White List<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy-and-the-white-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Host also has the option to configure a filter policy in a
<a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> which is also in the Controller’s link layer. When enabled,
policies can be set to filter out Link Layer events after they were processed
by the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-resolving-list"><span class="xref std std-term">Resolving List</span></a>. This provides a way of filtering devices if you
only want to communicate with certain devices at a time. The Host can update the
devices in the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> so that the
Controller can automatically process future connection or scan events.</p>
<p>The intent for the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> mechanism is to reduce power consumption
by filtering out undesired devices. The <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> will prevent the Host
from receiving packets about any device not in the <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a>.
By removing undesirable Link Layer events at the Controller, the Host can
remain in low power modes. In order to take advantage of white list filtering,
set the appropriate <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GapAdv</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GapScan</span></code> filter policies as
described in the BLE5-Stack API Guide.</p>
<p>The GAP Bond Manager can also be configured to have bonded device automatically
added to the Controller’s <a class="reference internal" href="../ble-stack-5.x-guide/reference-cc26x2.html#term-white-list"><span class="xref std std-term">White List</span></a> by setting the GAPBOND_AUTO_SYNC_WL
parameter. This automatically adds the peer device Identity Address to the White
List after adding the device to the Resolving List.</p>
<p>When a local device receives a link layer event from a peer device, it will
first check the resolving list to see if it contains an entry for the peer
device before applying the white list filter. If there is not an entry in the
Resolving List, the Controller will be unable to match the RPA it received to
the corresponding Identity Address information. If the Controller is unable to
resolve the address, it cannot match the Random address seen over the air to the
Identity Address in the White List. That means Host will not receive information
about a device using an RPA if the Identity Address is in the White List but not
the Resolving List. If you are using the GAP Bond Manager, with the
GAPBOND_AUTO_SYNC_WL parameter enabled, the BLE5-Stack will automatically handle
this behavior for you.</p>

<h3>Controller Responsibilities<a class="headerlink" href="#controller-responsibilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Link Layer privacy feature was introduced to enable device filtering when
RPAs are being used. This feature moved the work of generating and resolving
addresses to the Controller. The Controller relies on the contents of the
resolving list to interact with other private devices.</p>
<div class="section" id="generating-device-addresses">
<h4>Generating Device Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-device-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Controller will generate the local device address. The Controller uses the
local Identity Information in the Resolving List to generate its own address.
The Controller uses the local device IRK and the identity address to generate
the address is uses over-the-air. The RPA is generated using the Private Device
Address Generation procedure detailed in [Vol 6] Part B, Section 1.3.2.2 of the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>.</p>
<p>The Controller regenerates the RPA device address at the time interval specified
by the Host using the value of <a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/group___g_a_p___params.html#ggad3fe20690fa942f702d9009944fe4d38ab337d8055e0d3d4b34f4d1efa8160aad">GAP_PARAM_PRIVATE_ADDR_INT</a>. The
default value recommended by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a> is 15 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resolving-device-addresses">
<h4>Resolving Device Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-device-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Device addresses are used over the air in advertising channel PDUs. The address
type a device is using can be read in the TxAdd and RxAdd fields. If the value
is ‘0’ the device address used is understood to be a Public device address. If
the value used is ‘1’ the device is understood to be using a Random address (of
any subtype).</p>
<p>The Controller can attempt to resolve the addresses it sees Over the Air using
the Private Device Address Resolution procedure detailed in [Vol 6] Part B,
Section 1.3.2.3 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification Version 5.0</a>.</p>
<p>Devices are resolved by using the contents of the Resolving List. When the
controller receives a peer RPA, it will check the RPA against the identity
information of all the peer devices that have been added to the resolving list.
If it finds a match, it will check the device the device is present in the white
list (if one is being used), before sending the identity address with the
correct identity address type (PUBLIC ID or RANDOM ID) to the Host.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t find a match in the resolving list, the Controller will check to
see if a white list is being used. If there is no white list, or the white list
contains the peer device’s current RPA (because this may change over time,
proper white list management must be used), the Controller will use the RPA
and the RANDOM address type to send the request to the Host for further
processing.</p>
<p>If a BLE5-Stack device is using an RPA and it receives a request from a peer, it
must resolve its own address before it is sure the request is for the local
device. If the local device using an RPA receives a peer request that is
directed to the local device’s identity address, the local device will not
respond and the Controller will not send an event to the Host.</p>

Network Privacy Mode (peer device GAP Service contains an RPAO characteristic

<span id="sec-privacy-host-resolving"></span><h2>Host Address Resolution in BLE5-Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#host-address-resolution-in-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Address Resolution in the Controller using the Resolving List is the recommended
usage of the Privacy feature in the BLE5-Stack. However, in some cases, due to
Resolving List size limitations or other application specific reasons, an RPA
may need to be resolved in the Host. An RPA can be resolved to its Identity
Address in the Host (if a valid IRK exists in the bond record) by using the
<a class="reference external" href="../../doxygen/ble/html/group___g_a_p_bond_mgr.html#gac3dd9a10f8873d7f6b7685d69f80ae73">GAPBondMgr_FindAddr()</a>. This API takes an address and searches the bond
records for the associated identity address.</p>
<p>If a peer device is using an RPA that has not been added to the Resolving List,
the Host should refer only to connection handles and the RPA used by the peer
device when communicating with the Controller.</p>
<p>The number of addresses that can be resolved by the Host is limited to the
number of bond records you can store. However, the time it takes to resolve an
address will increase as more bond records are stored. This may mean that the
address isn’t resolved immediately upon connection. Another disadvantage to
Host-based resolving is that you cannot take advantage of device filtering in
the Controller using the White List because every unknown device using an RPA
needs to be forwarded to the Host.</p>
<p>The Host Address Resolution Method can be demonstrated using the Simple
Peripheral and Host Test applications with the following modifications:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>1. Test Normal Privacy Use Case using steps listed in</strong> <a class="reference internal" href="#sec-privacy-normal-usecase"><span class="std std-ref">Using Privacy in BLE5-Stack</span></a></dt>
<dd>Follow the steps above to properly configure Host Test and Simple Peripheral
for privacy and bonding.</dd>
<dt><strong>2. Prevent Bond Manager from Adding Devices to Resolving List</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">In most use cases, Host resolving will be a fallback in the event that the
number of trusted devices exceeds the space in the Resolving List. Because
we do not wish to bond to a large number of devices for this demo, we will
remove the code managing the resolving list from the GAP Bond Manager. This
modification is <strong>not recommended</strong> for most applications. It is <strong>highly</strong>
<strong>recommended</strong> to version control your source code before making this
change so it can easily be undone.</p>

<dt><strong>3. Test Bonding without Address Resolution</strong></dt>
<dd>The initial connection where pairing and bonding occurs appears the same

continues to only display the RPA. This means the address has not been
resolved by the Controller. We also will notice, if we attempt to connect,
that encryption is started which means that the GAP Bond Manager was able to
find a valid bond record for the device. However, no matter how many times
we connect, the Controller will not use the Identity Address when passing
information to the Host because the Controller is unable to resolve the
RPA it sees without an entry in the Resolving List.</dd>
