Power Management
----------------

All power-managment functionality is handled by the TI-RTOS power driver and
are used by the peripheral drivers (e.g. UART, SPI, I2C, etc..). Applications
can prevent, if they choose, the |DEVICE| from entering low power modes by
setting a power constraint.


With |STACK| applications, the power contraint is set in ``main()`` by
defining the ``POWER_SAVINGS`` preprocessor symbol. When defined,
enabled, the device enters and exits sleep as required for |STACK| events,
peripheral events, application timers, and so forth. When undefined, the
device stays awake.

More information on power-management functionality, including the API and a
sample use case for a custom UART driver, can be found in the TI-RTOS Power
Management for |DEVICE| included in the TI-RTOS install. These APIs are
required only when using a custom driver.

Also see *Measuring Bluetooth Smart Power Consumption* (SWRA478) for steps to
analyze the system power consumption and battery life.
