Privacy
-------

The LE privacy feature allows devices to periodically generate new address to
use over the air. This behavior greatly reduces the ability for a scanner to
track broadcasting Bluetooth low energy devices over a period of time.

There are two privacy variants defined by the |CORESPEC|: Controller-based and
Host-based. In Host-based privacy, the Host is responsible for managing all
aspects of the privacy feature - generating new addresses to use and resolving
private addresses sent by peers to determine their identity. In Controller-based
privacy, the privacy feature is largely implemented in the Link Layer of the
Controller. However, interaction with the Host is required for configuration and
to manage communication with other devices using privacy.

The |STACK| supports only the Controller-based privacy variant as defined by the
|CORESPEC| (Vol 1, Part A, Section 5.4.5). The Link Layer privacy feature is
always enabled in the |STACK|.

Privacy is discussed in the following sections of the |CORESPEC|. It is
suggested to review and familiarize yourself with these sections before
continuing.

Privacy and Address Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before going too in depth into a discussion of the |STACK| privacy
implementation, one should have a thorough understanding about Device Address
Types as defined by the |CORESPEC| and how they are used by the |STACK|. The
section below is intended to refresh the key concepts in order to provide
context for the topic of Privacy. For other important implementation details,
see the |CORESPEC| or the |STACK| API Guide.

Device Addresses in the BLE Core Specification
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

According to the |CORESPEC|, all Bluetooth device addresses can be divided into
two types: Public (0x00) and Random (0x01). The Random address type can be
categorized into two subtypes: Static or Private. The Private address subtype
can be further divided into two subtypes: Resolvable or Non-Resolvable. These
divisions can be visualized with the following tree:

Using Device Addresses in |STACK| Applications
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

**Configuring Local Device Address Mode**

A |STACK| application configures its own device address mode with the
``addrMode`` parameter of :ble_api:`GAP_DeviceInit`. This API must be called
when initializing the GAP layer and before attempting to start
discovery or advertising. See :numref:`gapbondmgr_enable_rpa`. It can only be
called once per device reset.

The modes that are supported by the |STACK| are:

+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| symbol                     | value | description                                                             |
+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRMODE_PUBLIC            | 0x00  | the local device will only use a Public device address                  |
+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRMODE_RANDOM            | 0x01  | the local device will only use a Random Static device address           |
+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID | 0x02  | the local device will always use an RPA that can be resolved to         |
|                            |       | a Public Identity Address. The device will only accept requests         |
|                            |       | from peers who use its RPA over the air. It will not accept requests    |
|                            |       | if the request is being directed to its identity address.               |
+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_RANDOM_ID | 0x03  | the local device will always use an RPA that can be resolved to         |
|                            |       | a Random Static Identity Address. The device will only accept           |
|                            |       | requests from peers who use its RPA over the air. It will not accept    |
|                            |       | peer requests if the request is being directed to its identity address. |
+----------------------------+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

A |STACK| device can only change its address modes using GAP_DeviceInit. If
the address mode is changed, or if a different Random Static address is used,
the |STACK| all existing bonds and local identification information will be
erased. The |STACK| does not allow the user to configure the local device to use
a Non-resolvable Private Address. By default, in the |STACK|, a Random Static
address does not change after a power cycle and its identification information
is stored in NV.

The device can use the GAP_GetDevAddress() command to easily receive local
address information for the device.

**Interpreting Addresses in** |STACK| **Applications**

Addresses can be received in GAP & GAP Bond Manager events. Address
information can also be queried using LinkDB. When receiving Peer Address
information, the values will be different depending on whether or not the peer
device identity information is in the Resolving List or not. The address types
that may be seen for peer devices is as follows:

+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| symbol             | value | description                                                        |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_PUBLIC    | 0x00  | the corresponding device address is a Public address               |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_RANDOM    | 0x01  | the corresponding device address is a Random address               |
|                    |       | of any subtype                                                     |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_PUBLIC_ID | 0x02  | the corresponding device address is using an RPA                   |
|                    |       | with a Public identity address. Receiving this type                |
|                    |       | means the RPA was resolved in the Controller.                      |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_RANDOM_ID | 0x03  | the corresponding device address is using an RPA                   |
|                    |       | with a Random Static identity address. Receiving this              |
|                    |       | type means the RPA was resolved in the Controller.                 |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_RANDOM_NR | 0xFE  | the corresponding device address is a Random                       |
|                    |       | device address that was not resolved to the local address          |
|                    |       | by the Controller. This type is used when receiving ADV            |
|                    |       | reports for directed advertisements if the local device is         |
|                    |       | configured to use an RPA. Since the address of the initiator       |
|                    |       | was Random and Not Resolved, the intended                          |
|                    |       | target of the directed advertisement was not the local device.     |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ADDRTYPE_NONE      | 0xFF  | this address type is only used when reconstructing extended        |
|                    |       | advertisement packets. The application does not receive this type. |
+--------------------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

If a device adds the peer identity information to the resolving list, it will
only receive the identity address in the application, not the RPA the peer is
currently using.

If an RPA is received for a bonded device in an event, this means that the
address is not present in the resolving list. The address can still be resolved
to its identity address at the application's discretion, but it will always
receive ADDRTYPE_RANDOM when receiving messages from the Controller.

**Communicating Address Information to Controller**

When specifying the address type of a peer device, the ``GAP_Peer_Addr_Types_t``
are used:

+-----------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------+
| symbol                            | value | description                                    |
+-----------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------+
| PEER_ADDRTYPE_PUBLIC_OR_PUBLIC_ID | 0x00  | the device address type as seen by the         |
|                                   |       | application is either a Public device address  |
|                                   |       | or a Public identity address                   |
+-----------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------+
| PEER_ADDRTYPE_RANDOM_OR_RANDOM_ID | 0x01  | the device address type as seen by the         |
|                                   |       | application is either a Random device address  |
|                                   |       | or a Random identity address                   |
+-----------------------------------+-------+------------------------------------------------+

If the application sends address type information to the Controller, it uses the
above types so that the Controller can determine what to send over the air.

Resolving Private Addresses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The addresses we generally use in privacy discussions are RPAs and Identity
Addresses. As mentioned above, a device using an RPA periodically changes the
address it uses over the air. This happens at a specified timeout interval. The
addresses it uses are generated with an Identity Resolving Key (:term:`IRK`).
This key associates the Resolvable Private Address to an Identity Address that
remains constant.

The privacy feature inhibits tracking from untrusted peer devices. However, some
devices may need the ability to recognize, and be recognized by, their peer
devices after their RPA has changed. Since RPAs are associated with an identity
address, they can be resolved to that fixed address, if a peer device has the
right key.

As mentioned above, in the Controller-based privacy variant, the Controller and
the Host each manage different aspects of privacy. Prior to Bluetooth Core
Specification v4.2, the Host was responsible for all aspects of privacy. The
Link Layer Privacy feature was introduced in Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2.
This feature hands off the repetitive work (generating & resolving addresses) to
the Controller, while the Host is responsible for configuration and
managing identity information.

The division of responsibilities between the Host and the Controller is depicted
in the flowchart below and is covered in detail in the following sections:

            Privacy Workflow

Host Responsibilities
"""""""""""""""""""""

Setting Privacy-related GAP Parameters
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

**Configure Local RPA Usage**

The Host is responsible for setting the address mode used by the Controller as
discussed above using the GAP_DeviceInit command. This contains the addrMode
the Host wants the Controller to use when setting up its device address. The
addrMode cannot be changed unless the device is reset. If the addrMode changes
between resets, the |STACK| will erase and regenerate all local identification
information as well as erase bonding information for known peers.

If a |STACK| device is configured to use an RPA, the Host will also share its
local identification information with the Controller upon initialization to use
for local device address generation and to resolve the local device address when
sent by peers.


**Resolvable Private Address Timeout**

When using an :term:`RPA`, the |CORESPEC| specifies a default timeout interval
of 15 minutes before the device changes its device address. This can be changed
via the :ble_api:`GAP_PARAM_PRIVATE_ADDR_INT` parameter in
:ble_api:`GAP_SetParamValue`.


Exchanging Supported Privacy Feature Information
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Any device that is operating as a Central or a Peripheral must contain the GAP
Service. The GAP Service contains 2 privacy-related characteristics: the Central
Address Resolution Characteristic and the Resolvable Private Address Only
characteristic.

In order to use Privacy, the GAP Bond Manager requires the stack's GATT client
to read the peer device's GAP characteristics. In order to accomplish this, the
stack must be built with ``GATT_NO_CLIENT`` compiler option disabled so that the
GATT client is included. See :ref:`sec-compiler-options` for more information on
how to change predefined project symbols.

**Central Address Resolution Characteristic (CAR)**

Any device operating as a Central that supports the Link Layer Privacy feature
must include a Central Address Resolution (CAR) Characteristic in its GAP
Service. The value of this characteristic signifies whether or not the Central
device can resolve its own address in the Controller. Since the Link Layer
privacy feature is always enabled in the |STACK|, the GAP Service implemented by
the |STACK| projects sets this value automatically.

A Peripheral wishing to send Directed Advertisements when the peer Central is
using an RPA must read this characteristic before proceeding. The |STACK| reads
this characteristic if the local device is a Peripheral that has bonded to a
peer using an RPA. This characteristic is checked by ``GapAdv_enable()`` when
attempting to send directed advertisements in the |STACK|.

**Resolvable Private Address Only (RPAO)**

If this characteristic is present in the GAP Service and its value is '0', the
local device will reject any incoming requests from peers if the identity
address of the local device is used over the air. The |STACK| applications
using Privacy will always contain the RPAO characteristic with a value of '0' in
their GATT Table.

The RPAO is read automatically by the GAP Bond Manager if it has bonded to a
peer using a private address. If a :ble_api:`GATT_MSG_EVENT` with an
:ble_api:`ATT_READ_BY_TYPE_RSP` with a value of '0' is generated, then the Host
sets the peer in **Network Privacy mode**.

However, if a :ble_api:`GATT_MSG_EVENT` response with a :ble_api:`ATT_ERROR_RSP`
or a :ble_api:`ATT_READ_BY_TYPE_RSP` with a non-zero value is generated, then
the Host will interact with the device in **Device Privacy Mode**.

Managing Identity Information
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

As mentioned above, RPAs can be associated with a long-term identity address
using an IRK. During Phase 3 of the pairing process, |STACK| devices using RPAs
exchange their IRKs and their Identity Addresses with their peers, as described
in [Vol3] Part H, Section 3.6 of the |CORESPEC|. From this point on, given that
a peer has shared a valid, non-zero :term:`IRK` and uses a
:term:`Resolvable Private Address`, the peer device can resolve this :term:`RPA`
into the associated :term:`Identity Address`.

If a Peer using an RPA exchanges an IRK containing all zeros, the IRK will not
be considered valid and its RPA will not be resolved. Only devices using Random
Static, Public, or Non-Resolvable Private device addresses should exchange a
zero-IRK.

Managing the Resolving List
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The Host is responsible for sharing the Identity Information it has
collected with the Controller for resolution purposes. It is also responsible
for removing devices from the resolving list when they are no longer needed or
if the Identity Information has changed.

If the Host wishes to use device filtering and still receive requests from
incoming known peers who are using RPAs, it must provide the identification
information to the Controller. Care should be taken in situations in which the
Resolving List and the White List are both used. If your application requires
White List filtering of devices using RPAs, please reference the
:ref:`sec-privacy-and-white-list` section below.

When the Link Layer Privacy feature was introduced, the :term:`Resolving List`
concept was also introduced. A Resolving List contains device identity
information for known devices that can be used by the Link Layer to resolve RPAs
in the Controller before passing events to the Host. The resolving list contents
determine how the Controller and Host communicate about devices using RPAs. A
Resolving List is necessary in order to use device filtering with devices using
RPAs.

A resolving list record entry consists of the following:

    * an Identity Address
    * the address type of Identity Address (Public or Random Static)
    * the IRK used to resolve the Identity Address
    * which Privacy mode the device is in (Network or Device)

After bonding with a peer device, the Host can create a resolving list
record entry for the device using the information shared during Phase 3 of the
pairing process. This entry is added to the Resolving List which the Controller
will use to process incoming RPAs. The :term:`Resolvable Private Address` of a
peer device is not used at the Host layer of the local device after bonding if
its identity information is stored in the Resolving List. Instead, the RPA is
resolved in the Controller and the Host is only given the associated peer's
:term:`Identity Address` when receiving messages from the controller. In the
|STACK|, the GAP Bond Manager automatically adds devices to the Resolving List
after bonding.

If the peer device identity information is not in the :term:`Resolving List`,
then the link layer may pass such link events to the host for further resolution
(if :term:`White List` filtering is not used). For  more information about
resolving addresses in the Host, see :ref:`sec-privacy-host-resolving`.

In the rare event the peer IRK is no longer valid, one of the GAPBOND_ERASE
parameters can be used to erase the bond record and remove the entry from the
Resolving List. If the device has been added to the Resolving List, it will be
removed automatically by the GAP Bond Manager. A peer IRK will only become
invalid if the peer device has reset its identity information for some reason.
This does not occur during normal operation but it might happen after a power
cycle, device reset to factory conditions, NV data corruption, etc.

Upon reset, the :term:`Resolving List` is empty and it's up to the host to
add and remove devices from the :term:`Resolving List`. This is automatically
handled for the application when using the GAP Bond Manager. Devices are added
to the Resolving List when a bond is added and are removed from the Resolving
List when the bond is removed.

If the local device receives incoming Link Layer events from the peer device
that is using a :term:`Resolvable Private Address`, it will attempt to resolve
the address using the known IRKs in its Resolving List to see if it matches an
Identity Address.

If the Resolving List is full, the Host is responsible for determining if any of
the existing Resolving List entries should be replaced if a new bond is formed.
Any request from a peer using an RPA not in the resolving list will be
forwarded to the Host as long as device filtering is disabled.

Resolving List Limitations
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The |STACK| has been tested & verified with a Resolving List that holds 10
entries. The size of the Resolving List can be modified by setting the
``MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES`` to the desired number. ``MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES`` must be
smaller than ``GAP_BONDINGS_MAX``.

Resolving Lists with sizes higher than 10 have not been extensively
profiled. Potential limiting factors to Resolving List size include available
Heap and resolution timing considerations: There must be enough memory to store
the desired number of Resolving List entries and each entry in the resolving
list increases the worst case time to resolve a private address. If it takes too
long for the local device to respond, the peer may have stopped listening. The
maximum Resolving List size the |STACK| can support is 56.

On the other hand, if you need fewer than 10 entries, you can reduce the size of
the resolving list to increase the performance of the device. The resolving list
must hold at least one entry if the |STACK| device uses an RPA as its device
address.

The Host Test application as configured in the :ref:`sec-privacy-normal-usecase`
section below has been demonstrated to resolve up to 56 private device addresses
when ``MAX_NUM_RL_ENTRIES`` is set to 56.

.. _sec-privacy-and-white-list:

Privacy and the White List
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The Host also has the option to configure a filter policy in a
:term:`White List` which is also in the Controller's link layer. When enabled,
policies can be set to filter out Link Layer events after they were processed
by the :term:`Resolving List`. This provides a way of filtering devices if you
only want to communicate with certain devices at a time. The Host can update the
devices in the :term:`White List` so that the
Controller can automatically process future connection or scan events.

The intent for the :term:`White List` mechanism is to reduce power consumption
by filtering out undesired devices. The :term:`White List` will prevent the Host
from receiving packets about any device not in the :term:`White List`.
By removing undesirable Link Layer events at the Controller, the Host can
remain in low power modes. In order to take advantage of white list filtering,
set the appropriate ``GapAdv`` and ``GapScan`` filter policies as
described in the BLE5-Stack API Guide.

The GAP Bond Manager can also be configured to have bonded device automatically
added to the Controller's :term:`White List` by setting the GAPBOND_AUTO_SYNC_WL
parameter. This automatically adds the peer device Identity Address to the White
List after adding the device to the Resolving List.

When a local device receives a link layer event from a peer device, it will
first check the resolving list to see if it contains an entry for the peer
device before applying the white list filter. If there is not an entry in the
Resolving List, the Controller will be unable to match the RPA it received to
the corresponding Identity Address information. If the Controller is unable to
resolve the address, it cannot match the Random address seen over the air to the
Identity Address in the White List. That means Host will not receive information
about a device using an RPA if the Identity Address is in the White List but not
the Resolving List. If you are using the GAP Bond Manager, with the
GAPBOND_AUTO_SYNC_WL parameter enabled, the |STACK| will automatically handle
this behavior for you.

Controller Responsibilities
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Link Layer privacy feature was introduced to enable device filtering when
RPAs are being used. This feature moved the work of generating and resolving
addresses to the Controller. The Controller relies on the contents of the
resolving list to interact with other private devices.

Generating Device Addresses
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
The Controller will generate the local device address. The Controller uses the
local Identity Information in the Resolving List to generate its own address.
The Controller uses the local device IRK and the identity address to generate
the address is uses over-the-air. The RPA is generated using the Private Device
Address Generation procedure detailed in [Vol 6] Part B, Section 1.3.2.2 of the
|CORESPEC|.

The Controller regenerates the RPA device address at the time interval specified
by the Host using the value of :ble_api:`GAP_PARAM_PRIVATE_ADDR_INT`. The
default value recommended by the |CORESPEC| is 15 minutes.

Resolving Device Addresses
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Device addresses are used over the air in advertising channel PDUs. The address
type a device is using can be read in the TxAdd and RxAdd fields. If the value
is '0' the device address used is understood to be a Public device address. If
the value used is '1' the device is understood to be using a Random address (of
any subtype).

The Controller can attempt to resolve the addresses it sees Over the Air using
the Private Device Address Resolution procedure detailed in [Vol 6] Part B,
Section 1.3.2.3 of the |CORESPEC|.

Devices are resolved by using the contents of the Resolving List. When the
controller receives a peer RPA, it will check the RPA against the identity
information of all the peer devices that have been added to the resolving list.
If it finds a match, it will check the device the device is present in the white
list (if one is being used), before sending the identity address with the
correct identity address type (PUBLIC ID or RANDOM ID) to the Host.

If it doesn't find a match in the resolving list, the Controller will check to
see if a white list is being used. If there is no white list, or the white list
contains the peer device's current RPA (because this may change over time,
proper white list management must be used), the Controller will use the RPA
and the RANDOM address type to send the request to the Host for further
processing.

If a |STACK| device is using an RPA and it receives a request from a peer, it
must resolve its own address before it is sure the request is for the local
device. If the local device using an RPA receives a peer request that is
directed to the local device's identity address, the local device will not
respond and the Controller will not send an event to the Host.

Respecting Peer Privacy
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

The Controller is responsible for maintaining the privacy of its peers who have
shared their keys. This means that if a peer device has indicated it is in
Network Privacy Mode (peer device GAP Service contains an RPAO characteristic
with a value of '0'), the Controller will only send requests to the peer device
using its RPA. The Controller will also not accept requests from a bonded peer
that has an RPAO characteristic with a value of '0' if it uses its identity
address over the air.

Network Privacy Mode vs. Device Privacy Mode
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The privacy mode a device uses is set by the Host and is part of the information
stored in a resolving list entry for the device. The Host sets this mode based
on the presence of the RPAO characteristic.

If the GAP Service of the peer device contains an RPAO, the Host will set the
device into Network Privacy Mode and only peer requests using their RPAs will be
accepted.

The |STACK| will consider the other device to be in 'device privacy mode' if the
peer device does not have an RPAO characteristic in its GAP Service or its RPAO
characteristic has a non-zero value. It will accept either an Identity
Address or a RPA as the peer device address.

A device can interact with a peer device exclusively in **Network Privacy Mode**
or exclusively **Device Privacy Mode**, not both.

.. _sec-privacy-normal-usecase:

Using Privacy in |STACK|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The typical privacy use case can be demonstrated using the Simple Peripheral
Host Test sample applications. BTool can be used to control and configure the
Host Test application.

Simple Peripheral Setup
"""""""""""""""""""""""

**1. Enable the GATT client.**

    The application must have GATT client functionality to read the
    :term:`Resolvable Private Address Only` characteristic and the
    ``Central Address Resolution`` characteristic. If ``GATT_NO_CLIENT``
    is defined in the project's predefined symbols, remove it.
    See :ref:`sec-compiler-options` on how to change predefined project symbols.


**2. Configure Simple Peripheral device to use Resolvable Private Addresses.**

    Modify :ble_api:`GAP_DeviceInit` as highlighted in
    :numref:`gapbondmgr_enable_rpa` to use a :term:`Resolvable Private Address`.

    .. _gapbondmgr_enable_rpa:

    .. code-block:: c
        :caption: Enabling Simple Peripheral to use Resolvable Private Addresses

        static void SimplePeripheral_init(void)
        {
          ...

        //Initialize GAP layer for Peripheral role and register to receive GAP events
        GAP_DeviceInit(GAP_PROFILE_PERIPHERAL, selfEntity, ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID, NULL);

          ...

    *Optionally*, add the code snippet highlighted in
    :numref:`gapbondmgr_private_address_timeout` to change the timeout interval
    in which the controller changes its :term:`Resolvable Private Address`.

    .. _gapbondmgr_private_address_timeout:

    .. code-block:: c
        :caption: Changing the time interval between :term:`RPA` changes

        static void SimplePeripheral_init(void)
        {

          ...

        // Configure GAP
        {
          uint16_t paramUpdateDecision = DEFAULT_PARAM_UPDATE_REQ_DECISION;
          uint16_t rpaTimeoutInterval = 5;

          // Pass all parameter update requests to the app for it to decide
          GAP_SetParamValue(GAP_PARAM_LINK_UPDATE_DECISION, &paramUpdateDecision);
          GAP_SetParamValue(GAP_PARAM_PRIVATE_ADDR_INT, &rpaTimeoutInterval);
        }
          ...
        }

**3. Enable bonding to share your identity with trusted peer devices.**
    ``GAPBOND_BONDING_ENABLED`` is a GAP Bond Manager Parameter that allows you
    to bond with a peer device during the pairing process. During this process,
    the devices share their IRKs so they can be known in the future when their
    RPAs change.

**4. Build the Stack Library and Application projects and flash the device.**
    After flashing the device, you can open a terminal using the standard COM
    settings: 115200, 8N1 (see BLE5-Stack Quick Start Guide or Simple Peripheral
    README.html for more information).

    The Identity Address (ID Addr) and the Resolvable Private Address currently
    being used (RP Addr) should display in the bottom of the Simple Peripheral
    terminal window.

Host Test Setup
"""""""""""""""

**1. Enable the GAP Bond Manager.**
    The default Host Test project is built without the GAP Bond Manager enabled.
    The GAP Bond Manager greatly simplifies the pairing and bonding process. The
    GAP Bond Manager can be enabled by removing the comments around
    ``-DGAP_BOND_MGR`` in the Stack Library project's build_config.opt.

**2. Build the Stack Library and Application projects and flash the device.**

Demonstrating Privacy Using BTool
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

BTool proficiency is expected. For more information about using BTool and how to
issue advanced commands, see the BTool User's Guide.

**1. Reset Host Test Device.**
    When BTool connects to a Host Test device, BTool begins the default
    initialization procedure. The default initialization procedure uses a Public
    Device Address. In order to override the default initialization, issue
    ``HCIExt_ResetSystemCmd``.

**2. Configure Host Test device to use Resolvable Private Addresses.**
    After the reset, send GAP_DeviceInit with ``centralProfileRole`` enabled and
    addrMode ``ADDRMODE_RP_WITH_PUBLIC_ID``.

**3. Configure Host Test Bond Manager.**
    The following parameters should be set using the ``GAPBondMgr_SetParameter``
    command:

    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | paramID                 | value                             | effect                                            |
    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE    | GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_INITIATE     | Sends Pairing Request upon connection formation   |
    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | GAPBOND_IO_CAPABILITIES | GAPBOND_IO_CAP_NO_INPUT_NO_OUTPUT | Forces JustWorks pairing so passcode isn't needed |
    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | GAPBOND_BONDING_ENABLED | TRUE                              | Saves Bond Record in SNV for future connections   |
    +-------------------------+-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

**4. Scan and Connect to Simple Peripheral Device.**
    After Host Test parameter configuration, you can scan and connect to Simple
    Peripheral using the Scan and Establish buttons in the Discover Connect
    Operations tab. Simple Peripheral will be advertising using the RPA
    displayed in its terminal window. In the BTool Advertisement Reports, you
    will see that the address type for Simple Peripheral is 0x01
    (ADDRTYPE_RANDOM).

**5. Disconnect and Scan again.**
    Disconnect from Simple Peripheral using the Terminate button in BTool. Use
    the Scan button to rediscover peer devices. Now, the Simple Peripheral
    Advertisement Report will display the Identity Address displayed in the
    Simple Peripheral terminal window. The address type is listed as 0x02
    (ADDRTYPE_PUBLIC_ID) which means the RPA was resolved to an IA before being
    passed to the Host.

.. _sec-privacy-host-resolving:

Host Address Resolution in |STACK|
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Address Resolution in the Controller using the Resolving List is the recommended
usage of the Privacy feature in the |STACK|. However, in some cases, due to
Resolving List size limitations or other application specific reasons, an RPA
may need to be resolved in the Host. An RPA can be resolved to its Identity
Address in the Host (if a valid IRK exists in the bond record) by using the
:ble_api:`GAPBondMgr_FindAddr`. This API takes an address and searches the bond
records for the associated identity address.

If a peer device is using an RPA that has not been added to the Resolving List,
the Host should refer only to connection handles and the RPA used by the peer
device when communicating with the Controller.

The number of addresses that can be resolved by the Host is limited to the
number of bond records you can store. However, the time it takes to resolve an
address will increase as more bond records are stored. This may mean that the
address isn't resolved immediately upon connection. Another disadvantage to
Host-based resolving is that you cannot take advantage of device filtering in
the Controller using the White List because every unknown device using an RPA
needs to be forwarded to the Host.

The Host Address Resolution Method can be demonstrated using the Simple
Peripheral and Host Test applications with the following modifications:

**1. Test Normal Privacy Use Case using steps listed in** :ref:`sec-privacy-normal-usecase`
    Follow the steps above to properly configure Host Test and Simple Peripheral
    for privacy and bonding.

**2. Prevent Bond Manager from Adding Devices to Resolving List**
    In most use cases, Host resolving will be a fallback in the event that the
    number of trusted devices exceeds the space in the Resolving List. Because
    we do not wish to bond to a large number of devices for this demo, we will
    remove the code managing the resolving list from the GAP Bond Manager. This
    modification is **not recommended** for most applications. It is **highly**
    **recommended** to version control your source code before making this
    change so it can easily be undone.

    .. _gapbondmgr_prevent_controller_resolving:

    .. code-block:: c
        :caption: Remove Resolving List Management from gapBondMgrAddBond()

        static uint8_t gapBondMgrAddBond(gapBondRec_t *pBondRec,
                                 gapAuthCompleteEvent_t *pPkt)
        {

          ...

            if((osal_snv_read(DEV_IRK_NV_ID(bondIdx), KEYLEN, oldIrk) == SUCCESS) &&
                (MAP_osal_isbufset(oldIrk, 0xFF, KEYLEN) == FALSE))
            {
            //       If a current record is simply being updated then erase previous
            //       entry in resolving list for this peer. Will subsequently update
            //       RL with new ID info for peer
            //    MAP_HCI_LE_RemoveDeviceFromResolvingListCmd((pBondRec->addrType & //Comment out RemoveDeviceFromResolvingListCmd
            //                                                MASK_ADDRTYPE_ID),
            //                                                pBondRec->addr);
            }

          ...

            if(pPkt->pIdentityInfo)
            {
            // Add device to resolving list
            //    HCI_LE_AddDeviceToResolvingListCmd((pPkt->pIdentityInfo->addrType & //Comment out AddDeviceToResolvingListCmd
            //                                 MASK_ADDRTYPE_ID),
            //                                 pPkt->pIdentityInfo->bd_addr,
            //                                 pPkt->pIdentityInfo->irk, NULL);
            }

          ...

        }

    After rebuilding and flashing Host Test application, you will have to
    reinitialize the application using BTool with the parameters set in
    :ref:`sec-privacy-normal-usecase`.

**3. Test Bonding without Address Resolution**
    The initial connection where pairing and bonding occurs appears the same
    with address resolution enabled. However, now, on subsequent scans, BTool
    continues to only display the RPA. This means the address has not been
    resolved by the Controller. We also will notice, if we attempt to connect,
    that encryption is started which means that the GAP Bond Manager was able to
    find a valid bond record for the device. However, no matter how many times
    we connect, the Controller will not use the Identity Address when passing
    information to the Host because the Controller is unable to resolve the
    RPA it sees without an entry in the Resolving List.

**4. Resolve Private Address to Identity Address using GAP Bond Manager**
    An unresolved RPA could mean that the bond record has been removed or that
    the peer device is using a new IRK that has not been exchanged. In order to
    determine whether the bond record is still accurate, we can try to resolve
    the address from the bond records we have stored. This is done by sending
    the :ble_api:`GAPBondMgr_FindAddr` command with the peerAddressType set to
    ``PEER_ADDRTYPE_RANDOM_OR_RANDOM_ID`` and the address from the Slave BDA in
    the Connection Info (Hint: To save from manual input errors, this address
    can be copied & pasted directly by right-clicking on the Slave BDA field and
    selecting "Copy Address" then pasting into the address field of the
    :ble_api:`GAPBondMgr_FindAddr` command).

    If a valid IRK exists in the Bond Record, the results of the
    :ble_api:`GAPBondMgr_FindAddr` command will be returned in an event showing
    the Identity Address and the Identity Address type of the resolved peer
    device. It is then up to the user to manage the resolved addresses for use
    in their application.
