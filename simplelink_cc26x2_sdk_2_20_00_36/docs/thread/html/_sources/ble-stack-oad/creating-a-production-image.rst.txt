Creating a Production Image
===========================

A production image is an image that is ready for flashing at the factory, and to
be released in a commercial OAD enabled product.

Change to Release BIM
---------------------

By default, the projects in the |SDK| will use a debug version of the BIM.
This is helpful for evaluation of the TI OAD solution, but is not recommended
for a production OAD build for the following reasons:

    - The debug configuration of BIM will not check the CRC of the image before
      booting. This removes a layer of redundancy in the system in favor of
      allowing the develop to load an OAD image straight from the IDE
    - The debug configuration has LED output that may not be desirable in
      production.

.. warning::

    When switching to a release configuration of BIM, images loaded straight
    from the IDE will not run after a reset. This is expected behavior as the
    oad\_image\_tool is responsible for populating the CRC field in these
    images. See the :ref:`sec-loading-a-release-image` section for more
    information.

Additionally, it may be desirable to remove the secondary device trim in the
application for production images. See :ref:`sec-oad-bim-trim` for more
information.

Loading a Production Image
--------------------------

Production images should use both the release configuration of BIM and the
application. As mentioned above, the release configuration of the BIM will
check for a valid CRC. Images loaded straight from the IDE will not have a valid
CRC. However, the oad\_image\_tool will add the CRC automatically at the
completion of each build. Refer to :numref:`fig-oad-downloader-and-target` for
a diagram of the build process.

Before loading the application, be sure to load the release BIM project. This
can be flash via the BIM's hex file in UNIFLASH.

.. warning::
    If flashing the BIM image (or a merged image containing BIM) using uniflash,
    be sure that the ``Keep CCFG data`` box is not checked. (Settings &
    Utilities --> Download). BIM will use a custom CCFG, so it is important that
    any existing image on the device is removed. Another safeguard is the mass
    erase the device before starting with OAD.

In release configurations, it is necessary to load the device using the
``*_oad.bin`` application file that is output by the oad\_image\_tool using
UNIFLASH.

    - The binary from the tool will be placed in the build folder alongside the
      default ``.out`` file.

The address offset should be 0x0000000 as shown in the screen capture below

Note the following error is benign and can be ignored for OAD images. Verify the
device has booted correctly by verifying the terminal output.
