Over-the-Air Download (OAD)
###########################

The following sections aim to describe the lower layers of OAD software that are
common across all protocol stack implementations. This includes the OAD image
header, the flash layout, Boot Image Manager, and the oad\_image\_tool.

.. toctree::
    /oad/intro
    /oad/bim
    /oad/image-header
    /oad/ext-flash-image-header
    /oad/flash-layout-off-chip
    /oad/tools

The following sections aim to describe the |STACK| specific application and
profile layer of the OAD solution. The OAD application section will describe
the BLE OAD process from a high level in terms of events and states, and the
profile section will cover the actual structures that are sent over the air.

See :ref:`oad_reference` for more information about the various OAD APIs and
structures.

.. note::
    The current |STACK| does not support on-chip OAD. Any reference to on-chip
    the following sections can be ignored

.. toctree::
    oad-application
    oad-profile

The following sections cover the out of the box demo for OAD using the |STACK|.
Additionally, the steps are included on how to add OAD to an existing project.
