Localization Toolbox
====================

The Localization Toolbox, or RTLS Toolbox, is a collection of RTLS (Real Time
Locating System) techniques that can be implemented on TIâ€™s standard Bluetooth
low energy radios in the CC26xx series. These techniques provide raw data that
can be used for locating, tracking, and securely range bounding other
Bluetooth nodes.

The inherent flexibility of the CC26xx RF Core is what enables this
significant extension of function beyond merely communications, and the main
advantages are that customers can start adding RTLS features and security with
little or no extra cost, very little additional energy consumption and no
increase in peak power.


There are two fundamentally different approaches to location finding:
