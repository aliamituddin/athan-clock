OAD Process
===========

|STACK| does not currently have an in-band Over the Air Download process.
|STACK| will use the BLE OAD process as its transport. Thread will use the
Bluetooth Low Energy OAD process as a black-box for the purposes of this guide.
The specifics of downloading the Thread image into external flash are not
covered here, consult the BLE User's Guide for more details on the process.

Thread will use BTool connected to Host Test on a |DEVICE| as the OAD
distributor for the process. This configuration is responsible for taking the
downloadable image and sending it to a BLE device with the OAD profile.

A BLE example application with the OAD profile (simple_peripheral,
project_zero) will be loaded on a |DEVICE| as the OAD target. This image will
allow BTool + Host Test to download a new image to the |DEVICE|. This example
image will also be marked as the factory image, allowing multiple image updates
by reverting to the factory image.

The running Thread image can be invalidated by pressing the Left button (BTN-1)
on the |DEVICE|. Once the running Thread image is invalidated, the BIM will
load the factory image from external flash. This factory image is the original
example image programmed on the |DEVICE|, in this fashion a new image may be
downloaded onto the |DEVICE|.
