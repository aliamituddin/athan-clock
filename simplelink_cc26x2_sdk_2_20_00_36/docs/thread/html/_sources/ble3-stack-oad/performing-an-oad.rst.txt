Performing a BLE OAD
====================

This section will detail the steps required to perform an OAD over BLE using
BTool. It assumes that the OAD Target and Distributor have been setup according
to :ref:`sec-ble-oad-setup`.

Modifying the Image Version
---------------------------

Modifying the image version is a quick and easy way to verify that the OAD has
completed. Some sample apps will display their image version in the terminal
window.

#. Navigate to the ``oad_image_header*.c`` file in the SDK.
#. Modify the ``SOFTWARE_VER`` field to increase the version number
#. Rebuild the application project, and generate a new binary ``*_oad.bin``.

    - The oad\_image\_tool automatically runs as a post-build step
    - The binary from the tool will be placed in the build folder alongside the
      default ``.out`` file.

OAD using BTool
---------------

    #. Connect to the target device using its BLE address

        - See steps in :ref:`sec-ble-oad-target-setup` for steps to get
          target address

        - Screen shot below shows how to connect to a specific BLE address in
          BTool

    #. Wait for the application's connection parameter update (if enabled)

      BTool will send a connection parameter update at the
      beginning of an OAD to attempt a faster download. The embedded application
      will also attempt a parameter update. It is recommended to wait until the
      application's connection parameter update has taken place before starting
      an OAD. If you are experiencing a slow OAD, this may be the cause. The
      parameter update is complete once the following message is shown in the
      BTool log:

      .. code-block:: none

          --------------------------------------------------------------------


    #. Once connected, switch to the OAD tab and load an oad image into BTool

        - If using on-chip OAD, be sure to un-check the box "OAD to external
          flash"

        - The OAD process has begin once the image identify is accepted.

        - While intermittent blocks are being sent BTool will display:
          ``Write Block Number = x of y``

        - The OAD process will continue until BTool displays
          ``OAD Download Successful``.

        - After an OAD has completed, you may need to manually hit the reset
          button on the |DEVBOARD| in order to trigger a full reset and jump to
          BIM. This step is only required after first programming the device.
          This will disconnect the debugger and terminate the debugging section.

        - After some delay (copying in the BIM), the new image should boot up
          and will be active.

.. note::
    The :ref:`sec-oad-tools` will run as a post build step to build an OAD
    enabled image. The output of the tool is a bin file with ``_oad.bin``
    appended to the name of the input hex file. This is the file to pass into
    BTool.
