Custom Hardware
===============

This section will explain how to adapt a Thread example application from the
|SDK| to run on custom hardware. In general, the steps required to migrate a
Thread example application from a development kit to a custom board are minimal
and involve changing the pin configuration as well as selecting the correct RF
configuration.  These steps, including a bring up guide, are detailed in the
subsections below.

.. _board-file:

TI Provided Board Files
-----------------------

The Thread example applications for the |SDK| import a copy of the Board
specific configuration files within the workspace. These files will have a name
based on the board name for the example. TI recommends that you use these as a
baseline, or to use one of the other Board files from
``<SDK_INSTALL_DIR>/source/ti/boards/`` as a base.

A board specific header will also be imported into the workspace. This file
will have the name ``Board.h``. This heder defines board specific functions and
pin mappings in the ``Board_*`` namespace. TI-RTOS drivers and |SDK| example
applications use these board definitions to allow remapping onto new boards.

Creating a Custom Board File
----------------------------

TI recommends to start with the existing set of board files when porting
a BLE application to custom development boards. When modifying or porting these
board files, the user should consult with
`TI Driver APIs <..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`__.

.. tip::
    Board files provided by TI include TI-RTOS driver configuration data
    structures for various drivers. If the application does not use the
    associated TI-RTOS drivers, the linker will simply omit them from the
    application image.
