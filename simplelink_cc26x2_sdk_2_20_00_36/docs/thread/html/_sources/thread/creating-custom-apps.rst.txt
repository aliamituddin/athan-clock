Creating Custom Applications
============================

|OT_STACK|-based system designers must have a firm grasp on the general system
architecture, application, and |OT_STACK| framework to implement a custom
application. This section provides indications on where and how to start
writing a custom application, and to decide which role and purpose the custom
application should have.

Adding a Board File
-------------------

After selecting the reference application and preprocessor symbol, add a board
file that matches the custom board layout. The following steps provide guidance
on adding a custom board file to the project.

#.  Create a custom board file (TI recommends using the Launchpad module board
    files as a starting reference).

#.  Modify the PIN structure.

#.  Add peripheral driver initialization objects, according to the board
    design.

#.  Include files from the folder of the start-up application.

#.  Add the custom board file to the application project.

#.  Update the C compiler search path of the IDE to point to the header file
    of the new board file.

#.  Define an identifier for the new board file.

#.  Rebuild the application project.

Creating Additional Tasks
-------------------------

Many implementations can use the |RTOS| environment to operate in the
application task framework. However, if the system design requires an
additional |RTOS| task, see :ref:`sec-rtos-overview-tasks` for guidance
on adding a task.
