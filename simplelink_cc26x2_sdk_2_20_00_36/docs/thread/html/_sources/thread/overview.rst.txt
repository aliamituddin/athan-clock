Overview
========

The |OT_STACK| is part of the |SDK|, which contains the supported software for
the |DEVICE|. The |OT_STACK| is based on the |OT| stack by Nest with the added
benefit of running on top of TI-RTOS. Please refer to the
:ref:`sec-software-architecture` section for more information about the
|OT_STACK| implementation.

    Do not use this document as a substitute for the complete protocol
    specification.  For more details, see the |OT_WIKI| and the Thread
    specification

The |SDK| is part of TI's SimpleLink MCU platform which offers a single
development environment that delivers flexible hardware, software and tool
options for customers developing wired and wireless applications. For more
information about the SimpleLink MCU platform, visit

Thread is an IP-Based mesh networking protocol that runs on :term:`IEEE`
802.15.4 radios. Thread was designed with one goal in mind: "To create the best
way to connect and control products in the home".

|OT| is an open source implementation of the Thread specification, which
includes all Thread networking layers and device roles, as well as Border
Router support.

Besides supporting all the |OT| features the |OT_STACK| has the added benefit
of running on top of TI-RTOS which inherently adds support for all the
LaunchPad ecosystem and peripheral drivers.
