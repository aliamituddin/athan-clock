Migrating TI 15.4-Stack Application
-----------------------------------

   This section describes how migrate existing TI-15.4-Stack based projects to
   the new TI-15.4-Stack release included within the |SDK|. Please refer to the
   TI 15.4-Stack Release notes to get a comprehensive list of all the changes in
   this release.

Steps for Porting TI 15.4-Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes porting an application, that was originally written for
an old of the stack, to the newer stack.

Follow the steps described below to port your TI 15.4-Stack star network end
node application and PAN Coordinator (Embedded and Linux based) to the new TI
15.4-Stack release. Also refer to the wiki link TI

   -  Download the latest |SDK|

   -  **Porting your embedded end node application**, it is expected that the
      developers would have started with the out of box sensor example
      application as a starting point for end node applications based on TI
      15.4-Stack. And primarily would add their application specific
      functionality to the files jdllc.c/h, sensor.c/h, and ssf.c/h in addition
      to their application specific implementation additions to the out of box
      example application. Also, customers would do their board specific
      changes. To port your applications to the new release import the out of
      box sensor example application into your CCS workspace from the new
      |SDK| (Please find the supported CCS version in the TI
      15.4-Stack release notes at /docs/ti154stack/ and refer to TI 15.4-Stack
      Users guide at /docs/ti154stack/ on how to import the TI 15.4-Stack
      example projects in CCS). :numref:`fig-sensor-migrate` highlights the key
      project files into which the developers can either bring their
      application specific changes into (preferred) or replace with their
      implementation. List below provides more details on how to port the end
      node application to the latest TI 15.4-Stack release.

      #. “config.h”: Port your application configuration settings into the new
         file. The new file has changes that allow to better use the
         application and 15.4-Stack features and it is recommended to use this
         latest file.

      #. “Jdllc.c/h”, “sensor.c/h”: Port/bring in changes specific to your
         application into these files; there are various optimizations to
         improve flash usage and also bug fixes. It is preferred to use the
         latest file and port your application specific changes into the new
         release.

      #. “ssf.c/h”: Port/bring in changes specific to your application into
         this file;

      #. Perform the board specific changes as done on the TI 15.4-Stack. The
         board files are included with in the folder Launchpad in the
         application workspace.

      #. If you need more details on the sensor example application which can
         help to port your application to the new release please refers to the
         TI 15.4-Stack Developers guide at /docs/ti154stack/.

   -  **Porting your Embedded PAN-Coordinator application**, it is expected
      that the developers would start with the out of box collector example
      application as a starting point, and primarily add their application
      specific functionality to the files cllc.c/h, collector.c/h, and csf.c/h
      in addition to the their application specific implementations additions
      to the out of box example application. Also, customers would do their
      board specific changes. To port your applications to the new release
      import the collector example application into your CCS workspace from the
      new |SDK| (Please find the supported CCS version in the
      TI 15.4-Stack release notes at /docs/ti154stack/ and refer to TI
      15.4-Stack Developers guide at /docs/ti154stack/ on how to import the TI
      15.4-Stack example projects in CCS). :numref:`fig-collector-migrate`
      highlights the key project files that the developers can either bring
      their application specific changes into (preferred) or replace with their
      implementation. List below provides more details on how to port the PAN
      Coordinator application to the latest TI 15.4-Stack release.

      #. “config.h”: Port your application configuration settings into the new
         file. The new file has changes that allow to better use the
         application and 15.4-Stack features and it is recommended to use the
         latest file.

      #. “cllc.c/h”, “collector.c/h”: Port/bring in changes specific to your
         application into these files; there are various optimizations to
         improve flash usage and also bug fixes. It is preferred to use the
         latest file and port your application specific changes into the new
         release

      #. “csf.c/h”: Port/bring in changes specific to your application into
         this file;

      #. Perform the board specific changes as done on the TI 15.4-Stack. The
         board files are included with in the folder Launchpad in the
         application workspace.

      #. If you need more details on the collector example application which
         can help to port your application to the new release please refers to
         the TI 15.4-Stack Developers guide at /docs/ti154stack/.

   -  **Porting Linux host + MAC CoP based PAN Coordinator application:** when
      using the Linux host + MAC CoP as PAN Coordinator developers can just
      upgrade the MAC CoProcessor application to the new TI 15.4-Stack MAC
      CoProcessor application without any application changes. The MAC CoP
      interface has not changed between the two releases.

.. attention::

   Preamble Change Previous versions of the stack used an RF preamble value
   that was not compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4g standard. In order to be
   compatible to this standard, v2.1.0+ of the stack uses the correct preamble
   as it is defined by IEEE. This means that devices running applications that
   were built with earlier versions of the stack will not be able to
   communicate with devices running applications that were built with the
   current stack version using the default configuration. In order to maintain
   compatibility with previously built applications, the user can force using
   the older preamble value by defining ``PREAMBLE_COMPATIBILITY``. Note that
   by doing so, the application will no longer be fully compliant to the
   802.15.4g standard.
