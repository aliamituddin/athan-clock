The Boot Image manager (BIM) project demonstrates how to select, copy and run an
image located in the internal flash or the external flash.

**Note: The ``cc2642r2lp_bim_offchip`` project must be flashed to the device when
using off-chip OAD or the device will not function correctly**

This project is independant of any protocol stack.
