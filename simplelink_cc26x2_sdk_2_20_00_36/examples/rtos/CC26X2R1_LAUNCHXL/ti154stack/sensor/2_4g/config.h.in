 Each bit indicates if the corresponding channel is to be scanned
 First byte represents channels 0 to 7 and the last byte represents
 channels 128 to 135.
 For byte zero in the bit mask, LSB representing Ch0.
 For byte 1, LSB represents Ch8 and so on.
 e.g., 0x01 0x10 represents Ch0 and Ch12 are included.
 The default of 0x0F represents channels 0-3 are selected.
 APIMAC_STD_US_915_PHY_1 (50kbps/2-FSK/915MHz band) has channels 0 - 128.

 Channel mask used when CONFIG_FH_ENABLE is true.

 be based on DH1CF function. When it is set to false, the sequence
 shall be a linear hopping over available channels in ascending order and
 shall be used to change channel during the join phase.
 It is represented as a bit string with LSB representing Ch0.
 e.g., 0x01 0x10 represents Ch0 and Ch12 are included.

 List of channels to target the Async frames
 It is represented as a bit string with LSB representing Ch0

 It should cover all channels that could be used by a target device in its
 hopping sequence. Channels marked beyond number of channels supported by
 PHY Config will be excluded by stack. To avoid interference on a channel,
 it should be removed from Async Mask and added to exclude channels
 (CONFIG_CHANNEL_MASK).
